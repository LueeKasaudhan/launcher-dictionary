# Launcher-Dictionary

Module based on Spellcheck plugin for Launcher module.

Spellcheck module inspired me to create this module. The main goal is to have a quick access to dictionary via Launcher module in Bodhi GNU/Linux.

## Usage

First one must load the module in modules settings under Launcher tab. Now assuming one has sdcv installed and an stardict dictionary, then usage should be as simple as opening Mokshas Quick Launcher and typing 'd ' without the single quote marks. Note: one must type the blank following the d. The prompt will change to a colon and now type a word that should be translated. A list as pictured above will be displayed.
Press "CTRL + u" key combination for the new word searching.

## Dependecies

* [EFL](https://www.enlightenment.org/download)
* [Moksha](https://github.com/JeffHoogland/moksha)
* [sdcv](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sdcv)
* [stardict dictionaries](https://tuxor1337.frama.io/firedict/dictionaries.html)

This module depends on sdcv utility. It is a console Stardict application.

sdcv installing:

```ShellSession
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install sdcv
```

Unpack downloaded dicts and copy to /usr/share/stardict/dic directory

# Installation

It is recommended Bodhi users install from Bodhi's repo:

```ShellSession
sudo apt update
sudo apt install moksha-module-dictionary
```

Other users need to compile the code:

First install all the needed dependencies. Note this includes not only EFL but the EFL header files. If you have compiled and installed EFL and Moksha from source code this should be no problem.

Then the usual:

```ShellSession
meson . build
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build
```
